# E-Commerce-Website-
This C++ e-commerce system demonstrates advanced data structures through a fully functional console-based shopping platform
This Website featuring a LinkedList-based shopping cart for dynamic item additions, deletions, and quantity updates; a Stack for undo operations tracking ADD/SET actions with LIFO efficiency; a Queue for FIFO order processing including enqueue, dequeue, and front display; and a Binary Search Tree for category management (Electronics at 10% discount, Clothes at 15%) enabling O(log n) searches. 
The system includes a pre-loaded product catalog with items like Phone (Rs.30,000), Laptop (Rs.80,000), T-Shirt (Rs.1,500), and Jeans (Rs.2,500), supporting features such as name-based product search, cart quantity updates, order history tracking, and intelligent checkout with discounts like Buy 2 Get 1 Free on clothes, 10% bulk pricing, 5% off over Rs.50,000, and free delivery above Rs.20,000. A menu-driven interface offers 12 options including viewing products, adding to cart, undo, checkout, processing orders, and delivery estimates (2-7 days), all implemented with OOP principles, manual memory management, and edge-case handling in a single DSA.cpp file—perfect for software engineering portfolios showcasing real-world stack, queue, tree, and linked list applications.
