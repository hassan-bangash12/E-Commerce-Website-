# E-Commerce-Website-
This is my First Project on Github of e-commerce website using c++ stacks, queues, trees, &amp; linked list. This project demonstrates efficient handlng of shopping carts (stacks for LIFO checkout), order processing queues, product catalogs (binary search trees for fast lookups), and dynamic inventories (linked lists for flexible insertions/deletions).
